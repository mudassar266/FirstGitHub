# in this chapter we are going to use variables: these are objects contoining sum values 

x =  5        # numeric variables 
print(x)

y = 'we are learning python'        # string variables 
print(y)


# types of variables 
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

# 3- do not use spaces while declaring a variable
